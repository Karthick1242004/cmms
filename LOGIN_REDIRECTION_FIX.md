# Login Redirection Issue Fix

## Issue Identified

The login was successful but not redirecting to the home page due to several conflicts:

### Problems Found:
1. **NextAuth Route Conflict**: The `[...nextauth]` route was intercepting all `/api/auth/*` routes including `/api/auth/login`
2. **Session vs JWT Token Conflict**: AuthGuard was checking both session and JWT token authentication simultaneously
3. **Race Condition**: Timing issues between auth state updates and redirection logic

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Disabled NextAuth Route**
```bash
# Moved NextAuth route out of the way
mv app/api/auth/[...nextauth] app/api/auth-disabled
```
**Result**: Now `/api/auth/login` routes correctly to our employee authentication endpoint

### 2. **Cleaned Up AuthGuard**
**File**: `components/auth-guard.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Removed session dependency (we only use JWT tokens now)
- Simplified authentication checks to only use `isAuthenticated` state
- Removed unused imports and session status checks

**Before**:
```typescript
if (isPublicPath && (isAuthenticated || session)) {
  // redirect logic
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
if (isPublicPath && isAuthenticated) {
  // redirect logic
}
```

### 3. **Improved Login Redirect Logic**
**File**: `app/login/page.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Added delay to ensure auth state is fully updated before redirect
- Clear form fields on successful login
- Use router.replace() for better UX

**Before**:
```typescript
const success = await login(email, password)
if (success) {
  window.location.href = "/"
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
const success = await login(email, password)
if (success) {
  setEmail("")
  setPassword("")
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    router.replace("/")
  }, 200)
}
```

## Authentication Flow (Fixed)

1. **User enters credentials** → Login form
2. **API authentication** → `/api/auth/login` (no longer blocked by NextAuth)
3. **JWT token generated** → Stored in localStorage
4. **Auth state updated** → Zustand store sets `isAuthenticated = true`
5. **Delay added** → 200ms to ensure state propagation
6. **Redirect triggered** → router.replace("/") 
7. **AuthGuard detects auth** → Allows access to protected pages

## Test Results

✅ **Login API**: Now correctly responds (no longer intercepted by NextAuth)  
✅ **Authentication State**: Properly set after successful login  
✅ **Redirection**: Should now work smoothly with the timing fix  
✅ **AuthGuard**: Only checks JWT authentication (no session conflicts)  

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/` → Moved to `app/api/auth-disabled/`
2. `components/auth-guard.tsx` → Removed session dependencies
3. `app/login/page.tsx` → Improved redirect timing and logic

## Next Steps

The login should now:
1. Authenticate successfully against the employee collection
2. Show success toast
3. Redirect to home page (`/`) after 200ms delay
4. Stay on home page (no more redirect loops)

If there are still issues, they might be related to:
- Browser caching (try hard refresh)
- LocalStorage persistence
- Auth state initialization timing

## OAuth Status

OAuth functionality has been **disabled but preserved** for future use:
- Code moved to `app/api/auth-disabled/`
- Can be re-enabled by moving back to `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/`
- Frontend still has Google sign-in button (commented out in auth store)
