4. 💡 Prepare S3 migration plan for when you hit 15-20GB

**Budget: $190-210/month**

### For 100 GB Scale:
1. 🔄 **Switch to AWS S3 immediately** - Save $84/month
2. 🔄 **Upgrade to MongoDB M30** - Better performance
3. 💡 Implement data archival (move old data to Glacier)
4. 💡 Set up auto-scaling for future growth

**Budget: $290-310/month (or $205/month with S3)**

## 📈 Key Takeaways

1. **Storage scales efficiently** - 100GB costs only 83% more than current
2. **Users drive compute costs** - 50 users = same server cost regardless of data
3. **Cloudinary free tier is generous** - Great until 25GB
4. **AWS S3 wins at scale** - 10x cheaper than Cloudinary for large data
5. **MongoDB scales smoothly** - Clear upgrade path from M10 → M30 → M40

**Bottom Line:** Start on current setup, switch to S3 at 20-25GB, enjoy predictable costs as you grow! 🚀
