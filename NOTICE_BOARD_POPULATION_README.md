## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"No auth token found"**
   - Solution: Make sure you're logged in to the application
   - Check localStorage for 'auth-token'

2. **"403 Forbidden"**
   - Solution: Verify your user has notice creation permissions
   - Check user role and access level

3. **"API endpoint not found"**
   - Solution: Ensure the notice board API routes are properly configured
   - Check that `/api/notice-board` endpoint exists

4. **"Backend server error"**
   - Solution: Check if your backend server is running
   - Verify SERVER_BASE_URL configuration

### **Debug Information:**
The scripts provide detailed logging:
- ‚úÖ Success messages with notice IDs
- ‚ùå Error messages with specific failure reasons
- üìä Summary of successful vs failed operations

## üîÑ Refreshing Data

After population:
1. **Refresh the notice board page** to see new notices
2. **Check the notice count** in the UI
3. **Verify employee attribution** shows correct names
4. **Test search and filtering** with the new content
5. **Verify edit/delete permissions** work correctly

## üìù Customization

To modify the sample data:
1. **Edit** `data/notice-board-sample.ts` for TypeScript version
2. **Edit** `scripts/browser-populate-notice-board.js` for browser version
3. **Add more employees** to the `sampleEmployees` array
4. **Add more notices** to the `sampleNotices` array
5. **Modify priorities, tags, and content** as needed
