# Reports Section Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the dynamic reports section that replaces hardcoded data with real-time analytics from the application's database.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Endpoints Created

#### `/api/reports/route.ts`
- Main reports endpoint that aggregates data from multiple sources
- Supports different report types: `overview`, `assets`, `maintenance`, `inventory`
- Supports time range filtering: `week`, `month`, `quarter`, `year`
- Implements fallback data when backend services are unavailable
- Includes department-based filtering for multi-tenant support

**Key Features:**
- Fetches data from existing endpoints (maintenance, tickets, assets, parts)
- Calculates maintenance costs based on parts usage and labor hours
- Computes work order completion rates from tickets and maintenance records
- Generates asset uptime metrics
- Creates trend data for charts

#### `/api/reports/stats/route.ts`
- Dedicated endpoint for comprehensive statistics
- Provides detailed metrics for all system components
- Calculates MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) and MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)
- Generates time-series data for trend analysis

### 2. Reports Page Updates (`app/reports/page.tsx`)

#### State Management
- Added loading states for better UX
- Implemented error handling with toast notifications
- Added refresh functionality with visual feedback
- State management for different report types

#### Data Integration
- Replaced hardcoded data with API-driven content
- Added lazy loading for tab-specific data
- Implemented fallback data for offline scenarios
- Real-time data updates based on time range selection

#### UI Enhancements
- Loading skeletons during data fetch
- Refresh button with spinning animation
- Dynamic stats display in header
- Error handling with user feedback

### 3. Data Structure Analysis

The implementation analyzes and utilizes the following data structures:

#### Maintenance Data
```typescript
interface MaintenanceRecord {
  id: string
  scheduleId: string
  assetId: string
  completedDate: string
  actualDuration: number
  status: "completed" | "partially_completed" | "failed" | "in_progress"
  partsStatus: MaintenancePartRecord[]
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### Tickets (Work Orders)
```typescript
interface Ticket {
  id: string
  ticketId: string
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'
  status: 'open' | 'in-progress' | 'pending' | 'completed' | 'cancelled'
  loggedDateTime: string
  totalTime?: number
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### Assets
```typescript
interface Asset {
  id: string
  name: string
  status: "operational" | "maintenance" | "out-of-service" | "available"
  condition: "excellent" | "good" | "fair" | "poor" | "new"
  purchasePrice?: number
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### Parts/Inventory
```typescript
interface Part {
  id: string
  quantity: number
  minStockLevel: number
  unitPrice: number
  totalValue: number
  stockStatus: 'in_stock' | 'low_stock' | 'out_of_stock'
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Key Metrics Calculated

### 1. Maintenance Costs
- Parts costs from maintenance records
- Labor costs (duration Ã— hourly rate)
- Time-based filtering for accurate period calculations

### 2. Work Order Completion Rate
- Combined tickets and maintenance records
- Percentage of completed vs total work orders
- Trend analysis over time periods

### 3. Asset Uptime
- Operational assets vs total assets
- Status-based calculations
- Performance distribution analysis

### 4. Inventory Metrics
- Total inventory value
- Low stock alerts
- Category-wise distribution
- Stock status analysis

## API Response Structure

```typescript
// Overview Report Response
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    overview: {
      maintenanceCosts: number,
      completionRate: number,
      assetUptime: number,
      totalAssets: number,
      totalTickets: number,
      totalMaintenanceRecords: number
    },
    charts: {
      costTrend: Array<{month: string, cost: number}>,
      completionRate: Array<{week: string, rate: number}>,
      uptime: Array<{day: string, uptime: number}>,
      maintenanceTypes: Array<{name: string, value: number, fill: string}>
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

### 1. API Failure Handling
- Graceful degradation to fallback data
- User notification via toast messages
- Retry mechanisms for temporary failures

### 2. Data Validation
- Type checking for API responses
- Default values for missing data
- Sanitization of calculated metrics

### 3. Loading States
- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Refresh indicators for user feedback
- Disabled states during operations

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Lazy Loading
- Tab-specific data loaded on demand
- Cached data to prevent unnecessary requests
- Efficient data aggregation

### 2. Parallel Processing
- Multiple API calls executed simultaneously
- Promise.allSettled for error resilience
- Optimized data transformation

### 3. Client-Side Caching
- State management for loaded data
- Intelligent refresh strategies
- Minimal re-renders

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- Use the provided `test-reports-api.js` script
- Navigate to `/reports` page in the application
- Test different time ranges and report types
- Verify error handling scenarios

### Test Script Usage
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the test script
node test-reports-api.js
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Real-time Updates
- WebSocket integration for live data
- Auto-refresh mechanisms
- Push notifications for critical metrics

### 2. Advanced Analytics
- Predictive maintenance insights
- Machine learning integration
- Trend forecasting

### 3. Export Capabilities
- Enhanced PDF generation with real data
- Excel export functionality
- Scheduled report generation

### 4. Dashboard Customization
- User-configurable widgets
- Custom time ranges
- Personalized metrics

## Dependencies

- Next.js API Routes
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Recharts for data visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui components

## Deployment Notes

- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Backend server URL configuration
- Database connection requirements
- Authentication integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Timeout**: Increase timeout limits for large datasets
2. **Memory Usage**: Implement pagination for large reports
3. **Authentication**: Ensure proper user context in API calls
4. **CORS Issues**: Configure proper headers for cross-origin requests

### Debug Mode
- Enable detailed logging in API endpoints
- Use browser dev tools for network analysis
- Check server logs for backend issues
